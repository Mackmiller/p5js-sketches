# Lorenz attractor

An animated drawing of a [Lorenz system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).

The Lorenz system is in 3D, so we need to pick a particular perspective to view. He we look along the y axis, using x and z as coordinates. This is to avoid a bunch of coordinate change math, and because the result is pretty.
